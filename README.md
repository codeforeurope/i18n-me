# i18n-me

This repository is meant to gather github repositories in need of [i18n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization). For sharing code across Europe the possibility to have the application in your language is essential. We believe i18n should be at the core of every Code For Europe project.

This is why we start this __challenge__: i18n me. We invite you to tell us about your project. We will then take on the challenge and help you to implement i18n.

## The Goal
 * Spend the month of january 2017 collecting projects in need of i18n
 * Implement i18n for as many projects as possible
 
_(We will also be using this challenge to get a first indication of interesting projects in Europe.)_

## Participating

Sign up for this repository. You can ask for access by creating an [issue](../../issues/new). This issue should have one of the following:

  * A project you would like to propose (and/or)
  * If you would like to participate in i18n-me helping out coding


## The Rules

The only rule is that you help out translating to your own language :)

This activity starts on January 1st 2017 and ends February 1st 2017.
